# Intro
This semester (Spring 2021), I am taking a Machine Learning & Datamining class (CS_434_001_S2021). 
This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning and data mining, focusing on classic topics including supervised learning (discriminative/generative learning, neural networks, support vector machines); unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction); ensemble learning (bagging, boosting); and fundamental issues in applying machine learning (model selection, evaluation). Lectures will discuss general issues in these topics and well-established algorithms, both from a computational aspect (how to compute the answer) and a statistical aspect (how to ensure that future predictions are accurate). Note this class does not cover deep learning. 

# Assignments
Four assignments including programming portions and question answering portions will be given during the term.

## Assignment 1 : k-Nearest Neighbor Classification and Statistical Estimation

In this assignment, I am going to implement a kNN classifier and get some practice with
the concepts in statistical estimation we went over in lecture. The assignment will help you understand how to apply
the concepts from lecture to applications.

## Assignment 2 : Linear Models for Regression and Classification

In this assignment, I am going to do some exercises about alternative losses for linear
regression, practice recall and precision calculations, and implement a logistic regression model to predict whether a tu-
mor is malignant or benign. There is substantial skeleton code provided with this assignment to take care of some of the
details you already learned in the previous assignment such as cross-validation, data loading, and computing accuracies.

## Assignment 3 : Naïve Bayes and Neural Networks

In this assignment, I am going to move through some exercises to understand Naïve Bayes a bit
better and then get some hand-on experience with simple Neural Networks in a multi-class classification setting.
